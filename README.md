# Regenerative Agriculture Dashboard

The Regenerative Agriculture Dashboard is a web application that provides key metrics and data visualizations related to regenerative agriculture practices. The dashboard aims to showcase the benefits and adoption of regenerative agriculture, empowering users with valuable insights.

## Features

- Soil Health Metrics: Displays data on soil organic matter, soil carbon content, and soil microbial activity, with charts and graphs to show trends over time.
- Crop Diversity and Rotation: Presents information on the diversity of crops grown using regenerative practices and the benefits of diverse crop rotations.
- Cover Crop Usage: Shows the percentage of fields using cover crops, the types of cover crops used, and the geographical distribution of cover crop adoption.
- Tillage Practices: Provides data on the percentage of fields using reduced tillage or no-till practices and the benefits of minimizing tillage.
- Regenerative Grazing: Highlights the number of farms practicing regenerative grazing, the total acreage under regenerative management, and the positive impacts on soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.
- Success Stories: Showcases success stories of farmers adopting regenerative practices, including testimonials, photos, and data on improvements in soil health, crop yields, and overall farm resilience.
