# Product Requirements Document: Regenerative Agriculture Dashboard

## 1. Introduction
The Regenerative Agriculture Dashboard is a one-page web application that provides users with key metrics and data related to regenerative agriculture practices. The dashboard aims to showcase the benefits and adoption of regenerative agriculture, empowering users with valuable insights.

## 2. Product Overview
The Regenerative Agriculture Dashboard will be a single-page application built using TypeScript and React. It will display various metrics and data visualizations related to soil health, crop diversity, cover crop usage, tillage practices, regenerative grazing, and success stories of farmers adopting regenerative practices.

## 3. Functional Requirements
1. Soil Health Metrics
   - Display data on soil organic matter, soil carbon content, and soil microbial activity
   - Visualize data using charts and graphs to show trends over time
   - Allow users to select specific fields or regions to view localized data

2. Crop Diversity and Rotation
   - Present information on the diversity of crops grown using regenerative practices
   - Show rotation cycles and benefits of diverse crop rotations
   - Include pie chart or bar graph to represent crop distribution

3. Cover Crop Usage
   - Display percentage of fields using cover crops and types of cover crops used
   - Provide information on benefits of cover cropping (improved soil health, reduced erosion)
   - Use map to show geographical distribution of cover crop adoption

4. Tillage Practices
   - Show percentage of fields using reduced tillage or no-till practices 
   - Explain benefits of minimizing tillage (improved soil structure, reduced carbon loss)
   - Use bar chart to compare adoption of different tillage practices

5. Regenerative Grazing
   - Present data on number of farms practicing regenerative grazing and total acreage under regenerative management
   - Highlight positive impacts on soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration  
   - Include line graph showing growth of regenerative grazing over time

6. Success Stories
   - Showcase success stories of farmers adopting regenerative practices
   - Include testimonials, photos, and data highlighting improvements in soil health, crop yields, overall farm resilience
   - Allow users to click on stories to view more details and real-world examples
